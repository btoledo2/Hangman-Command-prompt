# Hangman-Command-prompt
In this simple project in which Aaron Giang and I work we made hangman game for our second introduction course in computer science. This project uses a 2-D array to struct the hangman and vector array that compares the word from a selection words base on the difficulty selected. The game begins my asking the player to select a difficulty easy, medium, and hard. After selecting the difficulty, it will randomly select a word from the that file chosen by the player. After that itâ€™s a simple game of hangman selecting the correct letter be add to the empty vector array and selecting a wrong letter will add a part to the hangman. We made it possible for the player to save the game and continue later. Base on the difficulty selected your number of lives changes easy will let you have five incorrect selections before losing, medium will let you have 6 and hard will let you have 7.
