# Hangman-Command-prompt
In this simple project in which Aaron Giang and I work we made hangman game for our second introduction course in computer science.
This project use a 2-D array to struct the hangman and vector array that compares the word from a selection words base on the difficulty selected.
The game begins my asking the player to selected a difficulty easy,medium,and hard. After selecting the difficulty it will randomanly selected a word from the that file choosen by 
the player. After that its a simple game of hangman selecting the correct letter be add to the empty vector array and selecting a wrong letter will add a part to the hangman. 
We made it possible for the player to save the game and continue later.
